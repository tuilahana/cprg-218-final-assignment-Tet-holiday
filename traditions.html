            <p>Tet is filled with meaningful traditions, such as cleaning and decorating homes to welcome the new year.
                A key practice is ancestor worship, where families pay respects to their
                ancestors, and the giving of red envelopes with money<em>(lì xì)</em> signifies wishes for good luck
                and fortune.</p>
                <p>To extend our Tet greetings, we often convey our wishes with the words:
                Happy New Year <em>(Chúc mừng năm mới)</em>, may you have prosperity and good health <em>(An khang thịnh vượng - Sức khoẻ dồi dào)</em>,
                and may all your endeavors be fulfilled <em>(Vạn sự như ý)</em>.</p>
